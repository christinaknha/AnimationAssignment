                    <p>Pasteis de Belem is the OG location of pasteis de Nata, a Portugues pastry. 
                    It was originally made by the monks of Lisbon. 10/10 would recommend you try it here 
                    and at other pastry shops you see along the way. Add some cinnamon to it for an extra 
                    burst of flavor.</p>

                <article>
                    <p>If you are a gelato lover, you HAVE to stop by Amorino. They let you pick multiple flavors of Gelato 
                    and shape it on the cone to resemble a rose. The Gelato there is by far some of the best Gelato that I have
                    ever had!</p>>
