            <h1>A Honeymoon to Portugal</h1>
            <p>In the year of 2022, my husband and I tied the knot on April 9. The very next day, 
                we were on a plane to Portugal. My husband did all of the honeymoon planning since 
                I did the wedding planning so I had very little knowledge of what I was getting myself 
                into. But boy! We were only there for a week and it was one of the best experiences of my life. In this blog, I will outline 
                some of my favorite activities that we did and the food that I would definitely recommend 
                if you ever find yourself there. 
            </p>
