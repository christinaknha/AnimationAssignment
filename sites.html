            <h1>Things to do in Portugal</h1>
            <p>There are plenty of things to do in Portugal but depending on how much time you have, 
                the following three activities are do-able within a day each.

                <h2>Exploring Downtown Lisboa</h2>

                <article >
                    <p>We set up homebase in Lisboa. It's where our airport was and is a big enough city that
                        there is reliable transportation to get to and from other parts of Portugal without it 
                        being a hassel. It was also big enough that there was plenty to do if we did not feel like 
                        traveling too far outside.</p>
                    <p>There were a plethora of things to do in downtown Lisboa from seeing history sites and parks 
                        to shopping on Principe Real. Each street had plenty of hole-in-the-wall restaurants/cafes 
                        to try. If you ever got lost, public transportation was always nearby or you could call an Uber 
                        for less than $2.00!

                <h2>Hiking in Cascais</h2>
                <img src="BocaDoInferno.jpg" alt="image of boca do inferno">
                <article>
                    <p>Cascais is a beach town a short train ride away from Lisboa. You can explore the quaint city streets 
                        and allyways, eat at any of the restaurants with a view of the coast, or hang out on the beach. But 
                        if you ask me, the one thing you need to make sure you do is take the scenic trail to Boca do Inferno, 
                        also known as the mouth of hell. There are plenty of places to stop for a photo op and the views are
                        phenomenal.

                <h2>Exploring the Palaces of Sintra</h2>
                <img src="PenaPalace.jpg" alt="photo of Pena Palace">
                <article>
                    <p> Although I said Sintra could be a day trip, you won't be able to see everything in one day. It will require you to 
                        take the train to the mountanous regions of Portugal. From there, you will have to either catch the bus, a Tuktuk (highly suggest),
                         or an Uber to get to where the palaces are. From there, there are so many palaces to see and explore. You will do 
                         a lot of hiking. I suggest making sure you are wearing comfortable clothes, bringing sunscreen, and carrying some water.
